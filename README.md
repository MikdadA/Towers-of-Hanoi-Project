The Towers of Hanoi presents an intriguing yet distinctive puzzle featuring three rods, 
with one of them bearing disks arranged in increasing sizes â€“ from the smallest atop to the largest at the base. 
The challenge is to move the stack or tower of disks from one rod to another, 
with the restriction of only moving one disk at a time and ensuring that no smaller disk is placed beneath a larger one during the process.
